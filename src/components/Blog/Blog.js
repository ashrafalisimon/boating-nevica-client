                There is a lot of programming languages, development platforms, frameworks and tools for building application servers. As a software engineer, we always have to understand both the advantages and disadvantages and decide when to use which programming language or tool based on our needs.

                <p><span className='font-medium'>mongodb:</span>
                MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas.As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.
